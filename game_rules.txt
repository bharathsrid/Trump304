  1.0 Introduction
----------------

304 (Pronounced 'three nought four') is a card game popular in Sri
Lanka.  card304 is an electronic version of the same game and may be
played over the internet by four players.  To install card304,
please refer to the download and installation instructions below.


2.0 Basic Rules of 304
----------------------

It can be the followin number of players
2 or 3 or 4 players
In case of 4 players, 2 alternate players become a team


2.1 Card Value and Precedence
-----------------------------

304 uses a standard deck of cards excluding the jokers and cards 2
through 6 in all suites.  So the 304 playing deck consists of 32
cards, 7 through A in all suites.  Each card in a suite has a defined
value (or points) as given below.
	J - 30
	9 - 20
	A - 11
	10 - 10
	K - 3
	Q - 2
	8 - 0
	7 - 0

As can be seen from the table, the order of value of the cards is not
intuitive to newcomers to the game, and it would be useful to get used
to the above order as soon as possible.

During game play, when someone plays a card, it can be beaten only by
a card in the same suite with more points (or by a trump card, see below).

The object of the game is to accumulate a target number of points
*within a team*, i.e. between your partner and yourself. 

A quick calculation will reveal that the total number of points in the
32 card playing deck is 304

2.2 Dealing
-----------

The game begins with the dealer shuffling and dealing out the cards.
- The cards are dealt _four at a time_ to each player
- They are dealt in a  clockwise direction, starting with the
  first player to the dealer's left. 
- Dealer is player and dealer turn changes after every game in clockwise

Before the cards are dealt and after they are shuffled, the first
player to the dealer's left, may cut the deck if s/he so chooses.


cards are dealt starting to the left of the dealer, and proceed clockwise


In 2 and 3 player - 10 cards are dealt to each player in 3 rounds of 4,4,2 cards and the remaining cards are face down at the center
In 4 player game - all 32 cards are dealt - 8 cards each to every player in two rounds of dealing 4 cards each. there is no center pile of cards in 4 players


In 3 player - cards are dealt starting to the right of the dealer. Round 1 4 cards, round 2 4 cards and final round 2 cards. The remainig 2 cards are face down at the centrer

In 4 player - the cards are dealt starting to right of the dealer and goes right


2.3 Bidding
-----------

2.3.1 Four card bid
-------------------

When the dealer has dealt all the cards the bidding
process starts.  

Starting with the first player to the dealer's left, each
player can place a bid, as to how many points he expects his team to
get, were he allowed to choose the trump.


The person with the highest bid is
allowed to choose the suite that would be the trump for that game.
This person will be referred to as 'the trumper' in this doc.  A
'bid' is your estimate of the number of points you or your team
will get, assuming you get to choose the trumps.  If at the end of the
game you meet or exceed the trumper/trumper team wins. IF not the other team wins. One uniqueness is - in 3 player game once the trumper is decided, the other two forma team trying to beat the trumper


The rules of bidding with four cards are as follows
- bids must be in multiples of 10 points
- bids must be higher than half the total number of points; so the
  minimum bid is 150
- you may bid only once
- you may not overbid your partner, unless someone else has overbid
  your partner before you
- 200 and above are considered special bids and have higher
  risk/reward.  If noone has yet bid 200 or higher, and your next bid
  is going to be 200 or higher, you are allowed to break the previous
  two rules, namely you may in this case overbid your partner, and/or
  make a second bid.  
- even when bidding over 200, you may not overbid yourself, unless
  someone else has overbid you first.
- You may pass and not make a bid when it is your turn.  However, this
  will still count as one "bid" as far as the above rules are concerned.
- bidding typically goes in a  clockwise direction starting
  with the person to the immediate left of the dealer.  
- if no one submits a bid, the dealer is forced to bid a minimum which is 150

The number of points won by the trumper/opponent team is as follows

Bid		         Trumper wins		          Trumper loses
150 - 190	      Trumper gets 5 points		opposing team wins 3 points. only in case of 3 player game the opposing team mebers each get 3 points
200 - 300       Trumper gets 6 points   Opposing team wins 5 points. only in case of 3 player game the opposing team mebers each get 5 points
304         Trumper gets 10 points      Opposing team wins 7 points. only in case of 3 player game the opposing team mebers each get 7 points

2.4 The Trump
-------------

The trump is a suite chosen by the player who had the highest bid.  A
card in the trump suite will beat any card in any other suite, however
the trump may be played only if the player does not have any cards in
the calling suite.  When a trump is played to beat a card in a
different suite, that action is called 'cutting' (similar to ruffing
in Bridge).  If two players attempt to cut a given card, the player
who used the higher valued trump card wins.

The trump should be chosen and placed face down - before starting to play 
This closed card will be referred to as 'The Trump Card' in this
document.

*The trumper should not announce the trump to the other players.*

Once The Trump Card has been placed face down on the table,

Only In 3 player game: the trumper will have an option to place two additional cards face down and take the two face down cards that are remaining.Trumper can eitehr place two cards and get the two cards or not. there is no option of just placing one card down and picking one. the two face down cards will belong to the opponent while final counting of points. 

 
The Trump Card may not be used during normal game play.  The circumstances in which it may be played
are described below.

2.5 Game Play
-------------

The player to the immediate left  of the dealer starts the game play. only incase of a 304 bid, the trumper gets to start. 
Once he has played a card, play proceeds in a  clockwise
direction.  The next player has to play a card in the same suite as
the first card (this suite is referred to as the calling suite).
Whoever has the highest card in the calling suite after all 
players have played, wins all the cards that were played.  These 
cards are collectively known as a 'trick'. These cards may not be used
again in the game, and should be kept separate from the players hand.
In general, these cards may not be looked at until the end of the
game.  However, a player is allowed to refer to the four cards in the
last trick that was played out.   

The player who won the current trick plays the first card for 
the next trick. 

*It is important to note that the number of tricks won is
irrelevant.  What matters is the _number of points_ in the cards
that are in the tricks won*.

The objective of the team that kept the trump is to get enough
points to deliver on their bid, while the objective of the other team
is to get enough points to prevent the other team from delivering on
their bid.

Only in  two player : after every trick both players have to pick one card each from the common remaining pool with the winner of the trick starting first until the cards in the center pile run out. 

2.5.1 Cutting
-------------

When a certain card is played on the table if the next player does
not have a card of the same suite, he has two options
- he may attempt to cut
- he may play some other card which is neither the calling suite nor a
  trump

Unless this player is the trumper, he would not know what the trump
is.  So he has two options : 1. ask the trump what the trump suite is (If the trump suite is unrevelaed until that point) and the trumper has to reveal the trump card to everyone. the caller then - if he has the trump suite, will  play it and cut the trick. The trick belongs to the cutter unless someone subsequently puts a higher valued card int he trump suite. it the trump suite is already revealed the player can choose to directly put the trump suite to cut and own the trick
2. play a card from other suite. even if the suite is acccidentally the trump suite (trump suie is unrevealed so the player does not know), it has no effect. The trick will belong to highest card player.

IF the player chooses option one but odoes  not have the trump suite cards, then can play any other suite.


 The rest of the players then play their cards.  

If the trumper does not have a card in the calling suite and he chooses
to cut, he has to reveal the trump before cutting. if accidentally plays a trump suite card without actually revealing the trump first, it will not be considered a cut. 

If he chooses not to cut, the trumper may play a card of any other suite. 

Once the trump is revealed that card goes back into the hand of the trumper or if it is played into the trick pile. 

The trumper can reveal the trump only while someone asks to cut a trick or if the trumper himself reveals before a cut. if the game proceeds till the last rcard without the trump being revelaed, the trumper will pick and reveal the card on the last trick. 


2.5.2 Special Rules for Playing Trumps
--------------------------------------

Once the trump is revealed, if a player plays the trump suite the trick belongs to the player with the highest trump suite card in the trick. 



Once
everyone has seen the Trump Card, it is returned to the trumper's hand
and is no longer considered The Trump Card.

- Spoilt Trumps: Once all eight cards have been picked up by the
players and play commences, it may turn out that all eight trumps were
split between the trumper and his partner or by the trumper himself.  In effect, the opposing
team never had any trumps in this game.  Such a game is called a
'spoilt game' or 'spoilt trump game'.  It is declared invalid, and no
one wins


3.0 Deciding the result of a game
---------------------------------

Once all eight tricks are played out, the total points of all the
cards won by the trumper's team are calculated.  If this is found to
be equal to or higher than the bid amount, the trumper's team is
declared the winner and wins the points. If not, the other team is the
winner and wins the points





. In either case, the margin by which the
bid is exceeded or missed is of no relevance and points are
calculated based only on the table above. The 
winning team is paid its winnings by the losing team.  


4.0 Comprehensive Rules
-----------------------

The following are rules and special situations, not strictly
observed or encountered by beginners but still very much a part of the game.

4.1 time
-----------------

No verbal, signed or any such communication is allowed between
players during a game, other than what is possible by the playing of
the cards and stating of bids.  At the conclusion of a game and
before the cards are dealt for the next game, communication is allowed.


4.2 Rule Violations
-------------------

Violation of any of the rules results in the opposing team being
awarded the current game with its winnings plus two more tokens.  This
includes incorrectly calling spoilt games, or otherwise inadvertantly
breaking the rules.





4.4 Shuffling Rules
-------------------

A frequent complaint of beginners to 304 is that there seems to be
some blatant manipulation of cards during shuffling.  The rules
governing shuffling are:
- the dealer may not look at the face of any of the cards while
  shuffling or dealing
- the dealer may not arrange cards in a certain way before the shuffle
- the dealer may not count out cards or attempt to move cards on an
  individual basis during the shuffle 
- the deck should not be split between shuffles -- after each shuffle,
  the deck must be a homogenous whole
- the shuffling and dealing must be done in such a way that it is
  clearly visible to all the players

What is not required is that the cards be shuffled thoroughly.  Thus
an attempt is sometimes made to shuffle the cards minimally, or in
whatever way that is perceived to give the dealer an advantage.  It is
fair to say, that any advantage that may be achieved by this can
easily be nullified by intelligently cutting the deck before it is
dealt. All the rules of shuffling apply to cutting as well.
